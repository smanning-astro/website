**WEBSITE CONSTRUCTION IN PROGRESS**

**Research Interests:** I am an observational astronomer broadly interested in galaxy formation and evolution with a focus on dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at high (z>3) redshift. DSFGs are heavily dust-obscured galaxies undergoing bursts of star-formation. The unknown abundance of DSFGs in the early Universe calls into question our current understanding of massive galaxy evolution and leaves us asking: 1) How ubiquitous are DSFGs in the first ~2 billion years of the Universe? and 2) How do these galaxies evolve over time? I use observations at (sub)millimeter wavelengths with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) along with ancillary data from extragalactic legacy fields to detect and physically characterize these intriguing systems.

Currently, I am working to understand a subsample of the DSFG population at z>4 characterized by their lack of detections in the deepest optical/near-infrared surveys available. These "OIR-dark" DSFGs occupy a dynamic range of stellar masses and star-formation rates, appearing as extreme starbursts, more moderate systems, and everything in between. The aim of this research is to determine the prevalence of OIR-dark DSFGs and ascertain their evolutionary pathways.
