**Research Interests:** I am an observational astronomer broadly interested in galaxy formation and evolution with a focus on dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at high (z>3) redshift. DSFGs are heavily dust-obscured galaxies undergoing bursts of star-formation. The unknown abundance of DSFGs in the early Universe calls into question our current understanding of massive galaxy evolution and leaves us asking: 1) How ubiquitous are DSFGs in the first ~2 billion years of the Universe? and 2) How do these galaxies evolve over time? I use observations at (sub)millimeter wavelengths with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) along with ancillary data from extragalactic legacy fields to detect and physically characterize these intriguing systems.

Currently, I am working to understand a subsample of the DSFG population at z>4 characterized by their lack of detections in the deepest optical/near-infrared surveys available. These "OIR-dark" DSFGs occupy a dynamic range of stellar masses and star-formation rates, appearing as extreme starbursts, more moderate systems, and everything in between. The aim of this research is to determine the prevalence of OIR-dark DSFGs and ascertain their evolutionary pathways.



**Biography:** After growing up in Seattle, Washington, I moved across the country to the other Washington (D.C.) where I earned a B.S. in Physics and B.A. in Spanish from Howard University. I then packed up and moved south to the Lone Star State in order to attend graduate school at UT Austin. I earned my Ph.D. in Astronomy from UT in August 2021.  I've been fortunate enough to spend significant time in places outside the U.S., having lived in Buenos Aires, Argentina for five months while in college and another five months in Copenhagen, Denmark while in graduate school. Along with traveling, I love trying new foods and going out dancing. Anyone who knows me is also aware of my not-so mild obsession with soccer.
